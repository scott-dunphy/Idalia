            Please refer to the NHC NOAA website for additional information (https://www.nhc.noaa.gov).
        These represent probabilities of sustained (1-minute average) surface wind speeds equal to or exceeding 64 kt (74 mph). These wind speed probabilities are based on the official National Hurricane Center (NHC) track, intensity, and wind radii forecasts, and on NHC forecast error statistics for those forecast variables during recent years. Each probability provides cumulative probabilities that wind speeds of at least 74 mph will occur during cumulative time periods at each specific point on the map. The cumulative periods begin at the start of the forecast period and extend through the entire 5-day forecast period at cumulative 12-hour intervals (i.e., 0-12 h, 0-24 h, 0-36 h, ... , 0-120 h). To assess the overall risk of experiencing winds of at least 74 mph at any location, the 120-h graphics are recommended.

It is important for users to realize that wind speed probabilities that might seem relatively small at their location might still be quite significant, since they indicate that there is a chance that a damaging or even extreme event could occur that warrants preparations to protect lives and property.
